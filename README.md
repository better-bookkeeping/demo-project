# Setlist

**A no-nonsense strength training log.**

Setlist is for people who lift. You open it at the gym, start a workout, and log every set as you go: the movement, the weight, and the reps. When you're done you mark the workout complete and it moves into your history.

## Where the product is today

The first version covers logging:

- **Accounts**: users can create an account and sign in with email and password.
- **Movements**: users build up a library of the exercises they do, like "Bench Press", "Back Squat", or "Dumbbell Curl".
- **Current workout**: users start a workout, add sets (movement, weight, reps), remove mistakes, and complete the workout.
- **Workout history**: users review completed workouts and delete ones they don't want to keep.

Logging works, but users can't see whether they're getting stronger. They also can't log body-weight training properly. The next milestone is about **progress**, and that milestone is your assignment.

## Your assignment

1. **Body weight tracking.** Let users record their body weight so they can track it over time. Show a chart of their body weight history.

2. **Body-weight movements.** Pull-ups, push-ups, and dips don't fit the current model well. When creating a movement on the Movements page, let the user flag it as **body-weight**. When a body-weight movement is added to the current workout, the weight field should default to the user's most recently recorded body weight.

3. **Progression charts.** Workout history should show users how they're progressing. Add a chart where the user picks a movement and a metric, then sees that metric plotted over time. Metrics:
   - **Max weight**: the heaviest weight lifted for that movement on a given day
   - **Total reps**
   - **Total volume**: the volume of a set is `weight × reps`, and the total volume for a movement is the sum across all of its sets in a workout

4. **End-to-end tests.** There aren't any yet. Implement the skipped test cases in `e2e/` with Playwright. The scaffolding is in place:
   - `e2e/movements.spec.ts`: creating and listing movements
   - `e2e/sets.spec.ts`: adding, listing, and removing sets
   - `e2e/workouts.spec.ts`: starting, completing, listing, and deleting workouts

5. **Security fix.** Passwords are currently stored in plaintext. Hash them with a secure algorithm such as bcrypt or argon2, and update sign-up and sign-in to match.

### Stretch goals

- **Nutrition**: how would you add nutrition tracking? Consider macros (carbs, protein, fat), calories, and a calorie surplus or deficit.
- **Data model and performance**: tell us what we're doing wrong, then show us how you'd handle harder problems such as an admin board that summarizes the users in the system.
- **Security**: beyond password hashing, what would you improve? Consider rate limiting, CSRF protection, and session management.
- **UI polish**: the UI is very basic. Show us how you'd make it look clean and professional.

### What happens next

There will be a code review of your work, so be ready to explain how you implemented each feature and why you made the choices you did.

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for your commit messages, for example `feat(movements): add body-weight flag`. A git hook checks every commit message.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3 or newer
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22 or newer. Playwright's test runner needs Node, and without it `bun run test` exits without running anything.
- Docker with Compose 2.24 or newer, for example Docker Desktop or OrbStack

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies. This also generates the Prisma client and installs the git hooks.
bun install

# Start Postgres and the app in Docker with hot reload.
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and create an account. Pending database migrations run automatically every time the app container starts.

Stop everything with `bun run dev:down`.

### Running the e2e tests

```bash
# One time: download the browser Playwright drives.
# On Linux, use `bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium` to also install system libraries.
bunx playwright install chromium

# Run the suite. The app must be running (bun run dev).
bun run test
```

### Changing the database schema

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. Create and apply a migration: `bun run db:migrate --name describe-your-change`. This runs against the Docker Postgres and regenerates the Prisma client on your machine.
3. The app container watches `prisma/`, so it rebuilds on its own and picks up the new client.

To wipe the database and re-apply every migration, run `bun run db:reset`.

### Configuration

The committed `.env` file holds every value needed for local development. None of them are secrets. To override a value for the app, put it in a `.env.local` file, which is gitignored.

| Service  | Address                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| App      | http://localhost:3000                                    |
| Postgres | `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:55432/setlist` |

Postgres listens on host port `55432` instead of `5432` so it doesn't conflict with a Postgres you may already have installed.

### Scripts

| Script               | What it does                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`        | Start Postgres and the app in Docker with watch mode |
| `bun run dev:down`   | Stop the Docker services                             |
| `bun run db:migrate` | Create and apply a Prisma migration                  |
| `bun run db:reset`   | Drop the database and re-apply all migrations        |
| `bun run typecheck`  | Type-check the project                               |
| `bun run build`      | Build for production                                 |
| `bun run test`       | Run the Playwright e2e tests                         |
| `bun run test:ui`    | Run the e2e tests in Playwright's UI mode            |
| `bun run format`     | Format the code with Prettier                        |
